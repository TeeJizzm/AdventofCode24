# Advent of Code 2024

My attempt at Advent of Code for 2024
Problems attempted in Python, Go, and Rust.

Each day's problems are detailed in a matching folder.
Files for example and input data is found in the `inc` folder.

## Running Python scripts

Some reusable scripts with custom tools have been included in the `tools` folder.
Python scripts included in here must be added to `$PYTHONPATH`.

From CLI, the scipts can be run from the root of this repository with the following:

```cli
    python dayXX/dayXX.py
```

## Running Go scripts

Go files can similarly be run from CLI using:

```cli
    go run dayXX/dayXX.go
```
